# Keyboard Code Upgrader Analysis

## Applied Modernizations

Since there's no specific "keyboard code upgrader" tool in the ZMK ecosystem, I've applied manual modernizations based on ZMK 0.3.0+ best practices:

### ‚úÖ Already Modern Features
- **Syntax**: All properties use correct hyphen notation (`quick-tap-ms`, `tapping-term-ms`, etc.)
- **Home Row Mods**: Using modern positional approach with `hold-trigger-key-positions`
- **Timeless Mods**: Implemented `require-prior-idle-ms` and `hold-trigger-on-release`
- **Behaviors**: All behavior definitions use current syntax

### ‚úÖ Modernizations Applied
1. **Version Pinning**: Updated `west.yml` to pin to `v0.3` instead of tracking `main`
2. **ZMK Studio Support**: Added Studio-enabled builds with proper snippets
3. **Settings Reset**: Enabled settings reset utility build
4. **Build Structure**: Updated to match unified template format

### üîç Areas Analyzed
- **Combo Syntax**: Already using modern format
- **Keymap Structure**: Uses current best practices
- **Behavior Definitions**: All compatible strings are correct
- **Layer Definitions**: Proper structure and naming

### üìù Recommendations
The keymap is already well-structured and follows modern ZMK conventions. The main improvements were infrastructure-related (pinning versions, enabling Studio support) rather than syntax modernizations.

If a specific keyboard code upgrader tool becomes available in the future, it would likely focus on:
- Automated syntax validation
- Performance optimizations
- New feature adoption
- Deprecated pattern detection
